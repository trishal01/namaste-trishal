Dev Build
Local Server
HMR ( File Watching algorithm written in C++ ) // as soon we update, build occurs instantly
Caching , hence fast builds
Image Optimization
Minification files
Bundling
Compress
Consistent Hashing
Code spliting
Differential Bundling - To support different and older BROWSERS
Diagnostics
Better error handling (giving beatiful colored error suggesstions)
HTTPS - can host our app on HTTPS
Tree shaking - remove unused code (if we are not using some functions )
different dev and prod bundles
Transpiling
have web workers, server lorkers
lazy implementation
.parcel-cache file is used to cache, which makes app way faster

# Component Mounting Lifecycle

    Render Phase
        constructor (props and state creation phase)
        render - reconciliation (finding the difference in components)

    Commit Phase
        React update DOM (DOM Manipulation)
        Component DID Mount

# Optimization Principle

A component, class, function must have single responsibility feature

# DO LOGICAL Separation of bundling in app

dynamic bundling, chunking, Lazy loading, code splitting, on demand loading, dynamic import
